title: Relativity, A Few Thought Experiments
---

Back when I was in college, we were given a small book to read for our
introductory physics class ([physics for poets](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/928758.Physics_for_Poets)), 
not the textbook itself but an additional book. The book aimed to put the concepts we
were learning in a historical context and develop some intuition through
visualizing multiple thought experiments.

Unfortunately at the time, I did not get most of the value of the book. So a
couple of months ago I actually read the book and made a few assorted notes, It
is a great little book.

I am sharing some of these notes with you, perhaps it helps someone :).
