title: 'VLSI Design Methodology -- Class Resources'
---

These learning resources are to be kept for reference to describe class projects completed during my
graduate classes in Analog and RF IC design while at the University.

_Please note there may be still typos, omissions or unfortunately some old learning mistakes in some
of these (I am in the process of fixing them). If you could kindly let me know (issues or e-mail) I
could fix them when I have a bit of time._
