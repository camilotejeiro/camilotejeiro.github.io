title: Intuitive Statistics, Probability Introduction Lecture Notes
---

Intuitive statistics. Statistics may not be as dry as everyone makes it up to
be, there is logic and intuition behind it, it provides a new way to see nature
through the eyes of probability.

Here are some lecture notes I put together for a future video I am planning to
make regarding a quick Introduction to probability! I am hopeful I can put
together the video lecture up soon!
