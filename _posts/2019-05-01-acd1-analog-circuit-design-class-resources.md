title: 'ACD1: Analog Circuit Design I -- Class Resources'
---

This learning resources are to be kept for reference to describe class projects completed during my
graduate classes in Analog and RF IC design while at the University.

_Please note there may be still typos, omissions or unfortunately some old learning mistakes in some
of these. If you could kindly let me know (issues or e-mail) I could fix them when I have a bit of
time._
