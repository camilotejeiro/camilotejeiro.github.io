**Elegia a Jaime Molina**

For my last music project I have been putting together a musical score for the
famous Colombian Vallenato song by Rafael Escalona: “Elegia a Jaime Molina”, the
fingering for the melody part is placed on top of the notes and the fingering
for the bass part is placed on the bottom of the chords.
