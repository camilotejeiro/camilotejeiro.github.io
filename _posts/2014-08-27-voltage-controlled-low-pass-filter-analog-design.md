title: Voltage Controlled Low Pass Filter Analog Design
---

For this project the team was required to design a low pass filter with:

* A maximum pass band ripple of 2 dB

* An attenuation figure of 200dB / decade

* Adjustable cutoff from 15KHz - 30 KHz.

The final candidate for this design involved the use of operational
transconductance amplifiers or OTA's (refer to intuitive OTA's) and was designed
to be a 12th order butterworth gm-c low pass filter. Here is the design report
just in case you want to follow a similar approach.

Pictures of this circuit can be found in the next project.
