title: Graphic Equalizer Analog Design
---

Hi everyone,

For this last project we worked on a 7 band graphic equalizer using a simulated
Inductor or Gyrator to synthesize each stage's band pass filter. Here I leave
you with a quick video and a design report.

Here is the Design Report.

And the [video with the circuit in action](https://youtu.be/QKWozk7HAx4)

and the 
[improved enclosed version with better acoustics and a different output stage](https://youtu.be/5gZ8HsnYls4)... 
overall a huge improvement in sound quality:

Enjoy!
