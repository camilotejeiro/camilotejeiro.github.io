title: How To Win Friends And Influence People (Quotes)
layout: post
---

A while ago I put together a collection of quotes from the book by Dale
Carnegie: How to Win Friends and Influence people; It's a great book, Human
relations are very important. How we interact with other human beings really
determines who we meet, the opportunities we encounter and to an extent our
overall satisfaction.

I put all of the quotes in a 
[small text file](https://github.com/camilotejeiro/book_summary_quotes/blob/master/how_to_win_friends_and_influence_people_quotes-dale_carnegie.txt) 
and display one new quote every day on my phone (Here is the
[android application]({% post_url 2015-05-07-android-random-text-widget %})
I wrote to display the quotes). I also printed out the quotes and I read them
once in a while. Hope this inspires you to read the book :)

Cheers
