Over the past few months, I have been putting together a list of quotes from my
summary of 
[The Essays of Warren Buffett by Lawrence Cunningham](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/145565.The_Essays_of_Warren_Buffett).
This is a very interesting book. Both, entertaining for the average reader as
well as educational for anyone considering investing.

I put all of the quotes in a 
[small text file](https://github.com/camilotejeiro/book_summary_quotes/blob/master/the_essays_of_warren_buffett_quotes-lawrence_cunningham.txt)
and display one new quote every day on my phone. 

You can check the 
[android application]({% post_url 2015-05-07-android-random-text-widget %})
I wrote to display the quotes, as well as my previous book summary 
([How to Win Friends and Influence People]({% post_url 2015-07-19-how_to_win_friends_and_influence_people %})).

I Hope this inspires you to read the book :)

Cheers
