title: Remote Weather Station
---

This was a project done for one of my classes done to model a remote weather
terminal that gathered data from a "remote node", where we measured temperature
(via J thermocouple), salinity, carbon levels and flow rate, all measurements
were stored in an SRAM addressed in a circular buffer scheeme, data was
transmitted using an I2C protocol. The micro controllers used for this projects
were the PIC 16Fxxx and PIC18Fxxx.

P.S I apologize for the lack of pictures, this is sort of an old project. The
other projects get a bit more interesting.
