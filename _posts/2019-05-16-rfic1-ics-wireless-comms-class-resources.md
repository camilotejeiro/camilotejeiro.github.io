title: 'RFIC1: Ultra-Low-Power ICs for Wireless Communcations -- Class Resources'
---

These learning resources are to be kept for reference to describe class projects completed during my
graduate classes in Analog and RF IC design while at the University.

_Please note there may be still typos, omissions or unfortunately some old learning mistakes in some
of these (I am in the process of fixing them). If you could kindly let me know (issues or e-mail) I
could fix them when I have a bit of time._


## [Project 1: LNA Design](/linked_files/2019-05-16-rfic1-ics-wireless-comms-class-resources-1.pdf)

Low-power narrow-band LNA for use in 2.45GHz ISM band applications.
    
## [Project 2: Mixer Design](/linked_files/2019-05-16-rfic1-ics-wireless-comms-class-resources-2.pdf)

Current-driven passive mixer down-converter and TIA.

## [Project 3: Mixer Design](/linked_files/2019-05-16-rfic1-ics-wireless-comms-class-resources-3.pdf)

Class-b LC-oscillator-based VCO for use in a 2.45GHz transceiver for ISM band applications.
