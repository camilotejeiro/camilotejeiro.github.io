title: Generalized Impedance Converters GIC's
---

Here I leave you with a video explaining in detail the intuition behind GIC's
and how they can be used to simulate grounded inductors, capacitors or any other
frequency dependent components.

You might want to increase the resolution in the Youtube window for better
results.

Enjoy!
