title: Optimal Screen Properties for your Eyes 
---

_This is mostly empiric information I have compiled over several years from
various sources, and from my own day-to-day experience._

While there does not seem to be a perfect -- scientifically proven -- screen
properties to keep your eyes healthy, there are some worthy qualitative factors
to help keep your eyes comfortable while working at the computer **for long
extended periods of time**, for short computer-sessions the following factors
are probably unnecessary. (after all our eyes adapt very well to changing
stimuli)

## Screen Brightness/background

* A bright white screen background might not be appropriate for extended periods
    in front of the computer: just like a very bright sunny day -- without
    glassess -- or staring directly at a lightbulb/LED, it will strain your eyes
    -- make your eyes tired quickly.

* Similarly, a dark screen background might not be appropriate for extended
    periods in front of the computer, a black screen background will make your
    pupils dilate in order to capture more light and read smaller text, coupled
    with daylight or a well-lit room your eyes will strain -- for the reasons
    mentioned above.

As you can probably guess:

* **The key is in matching the screen brightness/color with that of ambient light.**
    Ideally you want the screen birghtness/color to match that of your
    surrounding environment, e.g: 
    + Light-gray/light-yellow backgrounds for _light themes_, or alternatively, 
    + Dark-gray backgrounds for _dark themes_
    
    > This reduces the effort/strain on your eyes when staring at your monitor.

## Text Contrast

While it may seem intuitive to have a high color contrast between the text and
background -- for  legibility -- and this is indeed the strategy used for
caution/warning and street signs, this is not necessarily optimal for long
reading sessions. 

* **A more comfortable -- medium -- reading contrast is preferred,** e.g: 
    + A dark-gray on light-gray/yellow backgrounds for _light themes_ -- 
        akin to reading a book on the shade, or a newspaper on the living room, 
        or alternatively, 
    + A light-gray on dark-gray background for _dark themes_ 

## Text Size

Personally (highly subjective), I have found that a 12 size monospace font is a
better -- more comfortable -- alternative to the smaller 10 size monospace
(commonly used), while still allowing plenty of space after the standard 80
characters column mark. 

However given my small (12.1" diagonal) current laptop display, on split windows I 
normally decrease the size to 10 monospace to fit all content. (this is not 
necessary if you have a larger display)
