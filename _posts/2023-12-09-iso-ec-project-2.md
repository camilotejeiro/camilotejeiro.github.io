**This is part 2 of the ISO EC Project.** 

_The ISO EC Project was initially introduced on [our previous article](https://camilotejeiro.github.io/2022/08/14/iso-ec-project.html)_

The updated ISO EC layouts can be found below.

### ISO EC layout intervals

The full (56 button) ISO EC layout is shown below with all semitone intervals annotated and color coded.

the regular isomorphic semitone intervals between buttons")

### ISO EC keyboard layout dimensions

The keyboard layout with annotated dimensions and intervals is shown below.

![Keyboard Layout](/linked_files/2023-12-09-keyboard-layout.svg "Image showing
the button and layout dimensions, also semitone intervals")

Also you can download a true-to-scale [Keyboard layout PDF](/linked_files/2023-12-09-keyboard-layout.pdf) for print and experimentation.

### ISO EC Scales Fingering Patterns 

The fingering patterns for all major and minor scales are shown below.

the major and minor scales fingering")

Also you can download a true-to-scale [Major and Minor scales PDF](/linked_files/2023-12-09-scales-major-minor.pdf) for print and experimentation.

The fingering patterns for all blues and pentatonic scales are shown below.

the blues and pentatonic scales fingering")

Also you can download a true-to-scale [Blues and Pentatonic scales PDF](/linked_files/2023-12-09-scales-blues-penta.pdf) for print and experimentation.

### ISO EC Chords Fingering Patterns 

The fingering patterns for all major & minor chords are shown below.

![Major and Minor Chords](/linked_files/2023-12-09-chords-major-minor.svg "Image showing
the major and minor chords fingering")

Also you can download a true-to-scale [Major and Minor chords PDF](/linked_files/2023-12-09-chords-major-minor.pdf) for print and experimentation.

The fingering patterns for all augmented & diminished chords are shown below.

![Augmented and Diminished Chords](/linked_files/2023-12-09-chords-aug-dim.svg "Image showing
the augmented and diminished chords fingering")

Also you can download a true-to-scale [Augmented and Diminished chords PDF](/linked_files/2023-12-09-chords-aug-dim.pdf) for print and experimentation.

The fingering patterns for all flat5 & sus4 chords are shown below.

![Flat5 and Sus4 Chords](/linked_files/2023-12-09-chords-flat5-sus4.svg "Image showing
the flat5 and sus4 chords fingering")

Also you can download a true-to-scale [Flat5 and Sus4 chords PDF](/linked_files/2023-12-09-chords-flat5-sus4.pdf) for print and experimentation.

## Next Steps

This is a very long time-frame project (I don't have much time, only a bit after-work sometimes),
but my thoughts on next steps are along the lines of: 

* Community feedback / interest (is the idea any good? is it worth spending nights on? :))

Then, based on above merit, baby-steps iterations towards:

* Getting some sort of non-functional to-scale proof of concept

Then if the idea still holds value, using an old concertina to try to repair/devise:

* A functional prototype.

_Although I am an engineer and have been working on this idea for some time -- as I am really interested in
squeezeboxes (accordions and concertinas) -- my experience in this area is very limited.
Nevertheless, I hope you found some of these thoughts interesting ;)._
