title: Our Goal, KipOpen Application
---

> KipOpen is an open community investment web application. 
> A decentralized online investment platform where informed consumers can 
> purchase open goods.

The KipOpen application is designed to provide a viable economic path for the
development of open technologies (specifically hardware and software). The
overall aim is to shift the current economics of open technology (largely based
on aggregate donations and corporate sponsorships) to a demand-sided model by
directly connecting informed consumers with engineers and developers (see the
[FAQ](http://camilotejeiro.github.io/osohm_website) for more general info).

KipOpen is developed such that anyone can download it and install in their own
average computer/server (e.g. a spare netbook or a cheap single board computer
...etc). Thus any interested person (most likely for profit/commissions) can
host a local open _marketplace_ where technical users can create open
designs/products and informed consumers can purchase and vote on those
designs/products.

> Our long term goal with KipOpen is to facilitate the commercialization of 
> open technology. We see a future where **open** is the de-facto standard for 
> consumer products.

An open and decentralized market where informed consumers can purchase open
goods to meet their everyday necessities is indeed a long-shot, but we believe
with the right economics, it is possible and that is our goal.

Finally the name, KipOpen stands for _Keep Intellectual Property Open_, but it
also stands for _Keep Investment Platform Open._ But after all it is 
[just a name](https://www.google.com/search?q=dilbert+the+name&gws_rd=ssl).
