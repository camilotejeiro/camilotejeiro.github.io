title: Investing Book Summaries
---

Hi all,

Here I leave you with light summaries for the books: The Intelligent Investor
and The Interpretation of Financial Statements

note: I made them by hand, so there might be some of my thoughts and opinions in
there, plus the writing and formatting is a bit disorganized.

[The Intelligent Investor](https://github.com/camilotejeiro/book_learning_notes/blob/master/the_intelligent_investor-ben_graham.pdf)

[The Interpretation of Financial Statements](https://github.com/camilotejeiro/book_learning_notes/blob/master/the_interpretation_of_financial_statements-ben_graham.pdf)

Hope it helps someone, or inspire them to read the books.
