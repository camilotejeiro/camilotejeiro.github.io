title: PN Junctions and Diodes
---

Here is the intuitive, visual explanation of Diodes, PN junctions and device physics

Material Covered:
	
  * Intrinsic Silicon
	
  * Doped Silicon
	
  * Mechanisms for carrier motion
	
  * Putting together doped Silicon, "The PN Junction"
	
  * Diode Operation
	
  * Leakage Current in PN Junctions
	
  * The capacitance of a PN Junction
