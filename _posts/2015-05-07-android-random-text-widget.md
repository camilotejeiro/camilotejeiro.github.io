title: Android Quotes Display Apps
---

There is an updated version of these apps (read more
[here]({% post_url 2016-01-08-android-quotes-display-apps-v2 %}).
I am keeping this post for reference.

Do you like to keep your notes in plain text linked_files. I am posting two little
widget applications that might make your day brighter. hehehe :)

So, For the longest time I was searching for a widget application that could
simply take a text file break it up into paragraphs, shuffle and store all of
the paragraphs and then display a new random paragraph daily or with the tap of
the screen.

After lots of time searching (mmmh maybe not that long) well at the time I
couldn't find a widget application that would just do this with no bells and
whistles, just a simple widget.

My use case was to use the widget to display my "life quotes" as well as some of
the book summaries I have made over the years in the front screen of my phone
and have a random quote or summary note everyday.

It seemed like a little fun project with a noble cause and... it also took quite
a bit longer than I ever thought. but that's alright I now have a new quote
everyday and it's pretty awesome.

So download the app, install it in your phone, see if you like it, and if not
well I open sourced the code, you can modify it to fit your purposes; hell you
could easily modify it to display the last few paragraphs and make it your todo
list, or perhaps integrate it with an explorer app to browse through your
folders. either way I tried to be very diligent in my comments, it shouldn't be
too bad.

So here is the meat (or the veggies i guess):

To access the widgets source code just clone the 
[android repo from GitHub](https://github.com/Osohm/android_quotes_display_apps.git) or just
download the zip archive and then build the projects. If you have an older
version of Android (Target Version 2.3) use the eclipse ADT projects  if you
have a newer version of Android (Target Version 4.4) use the android studio
projects

And if you just want the signed applications (compiled for Android version 2.3
and 4.4) download the .apk linked_files and install them in your phone (they are inside
the github repo under each project directory).

And remember this is a widget, so you can not run it from the app explorer, you
can only add it to the phone screen.

Here are some pictures of the widgets at work.
