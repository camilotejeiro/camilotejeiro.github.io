title: Learning Colemak, a Qwerty Keyboard Alternative
---


A better alternative? maybe? _Up to you,_ however here are 
[some stats](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?colemak#colemak_detailed_statistics) 
and a quick [FAQ](http://colemak.com/FAQ) page for your reference.  

## A couple of notes to get you started

_These are specifically for a GNU/Linux machine_ but i am thinking it probably
works similarly on other Operating systems.
    

_While you are practicing/learning to touch type try not to use stickers or 
modify your physical keyboard in any manner, later on you can use visual aids._
    
* **Get a typing practice application** (i.e. a touch typing program):

_[KTouch](https://edu.kde.org/applications/all/ktouch) is awesome, FOSSÂ  
and [easy to install](http://colemak.com/KTouch) (i.e. apt-get install KTouch)._
    
* **Set the Colemak keyboard mapping** for your machine:

> setxkbmap us -variant colemak
    
* **Launch KTouch**, set up your profile and start practicing.

_Better to unlock lessons as you go_
    
* When you have finished practicing for the day, **set your keyboard back to Qwerty mapping**.

> setxkbmap us

**Practice typing a little bit everyday as opposed to going cold turkey, 
otherwise it can feel very frustrating and you will probably loose heart**

> Baby steps to big dreams

Once you have finished all the typing lessons (i.e. the KTouch lessons) you can
go ahead and start typing in the wild :). It will feel a little slow at first
but you will get comfortable and faster as you start typing more. You will also
see some of the advantages of the Colemak keyboard (e.g. your hands do not move
all over the keyboard as you type, which does happen with Qwerty)

_Please note:_ This is an ongoing little experiment on my part and you should
also take it as such, do no expect to learn to type on Colemak in a couple of
hours and start writing/programming professionally right away (everything takes
practice).

_Your mileage may vary_

If you find mistakes or typos, kindly let me know so I can fix them :)

Enjoy and share with others.
