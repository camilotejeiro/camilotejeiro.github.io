**How do we learn?**

What is the process? What are the stages as we learn a new subject or pick up a
new skill? When are we most likely to quit? When are we most likely to reap the
rewards for our time invested? These are all interesting questions!

Over the years I have put together a personal learning graph (completely
empirical of course):
